# How to Run the Whole Script

1. **Ensure All Settings are Correct**:
   - Run the bash file with a single click: `run_script.sh`.
   - To restart the app, use "stop" in the message box. There is no need to use CTRL + C unless you want to terminate it finally.
   - Make sure all necessary settings (Manual, Preview, Wizard) are configured as per your needs.
   - Use the respective buttons to toggle these settings.

   - Click on the "Select Browser" button and choose the browser you want to use.

   - Respond with 'Y' to confirm and start the process or 'N' to cancel it.

By following these instructions, you can effectively use the bot's features and ensure the script runs smoothly from start to finish.

Lastly, I recommend first using the WIZARD mode to see how it works effectively! and be modified that Wizard mode is only available on Visitor visa üòé
