This is a Visitor bot visa.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Script

1. Click on this [link](https://github.com/koolboks/Kiran-Bot-Automation-Visitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the script.
2. Once downloaded, unzip the file. You'll find a folder named "Kiran-Bot-Automation-Visitor".

### Running the Script

1. Open the folder after unzipping it.
2. Go straight to `run_script.sh` and click it.
3. Take a coffee â˜• and relax because it will take longer time if you run for the first time.
4. After that, you will be directed to the [Telegram bot link for visitors](https://t.me/newBotFillerBot).

### Additional Notes

If you see 'Already Launched', please type in the bot message 'force'. This will reset the bot to ensure it runs separately and not in many coroutines.
